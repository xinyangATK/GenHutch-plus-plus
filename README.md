## Why Hutch++ in Generative Modeling?
- Lower variance and error in trace estimation compared to Hutchinson trace estimator.
- In generative modeling, Hutch++ is particularly effective for handling ill-conditioned matrices with large condition numbers, which commonly arise when high-dimensional data exhibits a low-dimensional structure. 
- Our practical acceleration technique that balance frequency and accuracy, backed by theoretical guarantees.
- Our analysis demonstrates that Hutch++ leads to generations of higher quality.

## Code Structure

We provide two separate projects of GruM for three types of graph generation tasks:
- Simulations with Neural ODE model
- Image data modeling with advanced SB-based diffusion models

Each projects consists of the following:
```
ffjord-plus-plus : Code for density estimation of toy distributions with FFJORD++
```

```
sb-fbsde-plus-plus : Code for image data modeling with SB-FBSDE++
```

We provide the details in README.md for each projects.
